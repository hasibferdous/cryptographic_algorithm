A comparative study of the cryptographic algorithms 3DES with 192-bit key and AES- with
128-bit key aims to evaluate, compare, and analyze the security, efficiency, and performance of
these two encryption standards. This study measures the encryption times of 3DES with
192-bit key and AES- with 128-bit key algorithms on files of varying sizes (1 MB, 100 MB,
and 1 GB) in order to compare their performance.


A comparative study of the cryptographic algorithms RSA with 1024-bit key and ElGamal
algorithm aims to evaluate, compare, and analyze the security, efficiency, and performance of
these two encryption standards. This study measures the encryption times of RSA with
1024-bit key algorithm and the ElGamal algorithm on files of varying sizes (1 MB, 100 MB,
and 1 GB) in order to compare their performance.
